                I'm a Computer Science graduate with extensive experience in both front-end and back-end design and implementation. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages and the latest web frameworks. I've built full-stack applications from scratch using Node, Django, and Laravel. Additionally, I have significant experience in creating AI-enhanced applications using LLMs and working with large datasets for data analysis. My passion lies in building innovative solutions through code. I am always eager to tackle new challenges and build quality software.
